Numerical Palindrome #3.5

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. Examples of numerical palindromes are:

2332 
110011 
54322345

For a given number num, write a function which returns an array of all the numerical palindromes contained within each number. The array should be sorted in ascending order and any duplicates should be removed.

For this kata, single digit numbers and numbers which start and end with 0s (such as 010 and 000) will NOT be considered valid numerical palindromes.

If num contains no valid palindromes, return "No palindromes found". Otherwise, return "Not valid" if the input is not an integer or is less than 0.

palindrome(1221) => [22,1221]
palindrome(34322122) => [22,212,343,22122]
palindrome(1001331) => [33,1001,1331] 
palindrome(1294) => "No palindromes found"
palindrome("1221") => "Not valid"
